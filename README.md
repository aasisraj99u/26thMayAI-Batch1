This is my 3rd Weekend Group Project on Tour Package Prediction.

<b>Task Details: </b></br>
Make a Machine Learning Model and deploy over Flask Server, including

Perform an Exploratory Data Analysis on the data</br>
Univariate analysis - Bivariate analysis - Use appropriate visualizations to identify the patterns and insights - Come up with a customer profile (characteristics of a customer) of the different packages - Any other exploratory deep dive</br>

Illustrate the insights based on EDA</br>
Key meaningful observations on individual variables and the relationship between variables</br>

Data Pre-processing</br>
Prepare the data for analysis - Missing value Treatment, Outlier Detection (treat, if needed- why or why not ), Feature Engineering, Prepare data for modeling</br>

Model building - Bagging</br>
Build classifier based on random forest, and decision tree.</br>

Model performance improvement - Ensemble</br>
Comment on which metric is right for model performance evaluation and why? - Comment on model performance - Can model performance be improved? check and comment</br>

Actionable Insights & Recommendations</br>
Conclude with the key takeaways for the business - What would your advice be to grow the business?</br>

Flask Server</br>
Deployment of model with Flask Server enabling the company to use the tool as a web-application</br>

<b>Expected Submission:</b></br>
Your submission must contain Jupyter Notebook file for Modeling and Flask Server Code with Templates and Static Files in Zip over Github along with your Flask Server URL
