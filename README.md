It was our First Group project created during the Summer Internship from Techinest Private Ltd, Jaipur Rajasthan. Our task was to predict the revenue of restaurant using linear Regression Algorithm based on the available dataset.<br>

**Task Details :**<br>
We have a restaurant dataset with us. You need to create a Machine Learning Model to predict the revenue. Also deploy the model into Python GUI application to fetch realtime queries over it.<br>

**Column Information :**<br>
Data fields
Id : Restaurant id.<br>
Open Date : opening date for a restaurant<br>
City : City that the restaurant is in. Note that there are unicode in the names.<br>
City Group: Type of the city. Big cities, or Other.<br>
Type: Type of the restaurant. FC: Food Court, IL: Inline, DT: Drive Thru, MB: Mobile<br>
P1, P2 - P37: There are three categories of these obfuscated data. Demographic data are gathered from third party providers with GIS systems. These include population in any given area, age and gender distribution, development scales. Real estate data mainly relate to the m2 of the location, front facade of the location, car park availability. Commercial data mainly include the existence of points of interest including schools, banks, other QSR operators.<br>
Revenue: The revenue column indicates a (transformed) revenue of the restaurant in a given year and is the target of predictive analysis. Please note that the values are transformed so they don't mean real dollar values.
